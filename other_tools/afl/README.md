This folder contains modified AFL and AES code for recording inputs generated by AFL on a native AES binary.

The native AES binary in compiled and stored in aes-native folder. This binary accepts a file with 16 space-separated bytes (example in aes-native/afl-in folder). Right now, this binary writes the content of its input file to a file named afl-keys.txt, before it executes. A sample afl-keys.txt file is present in this folder.

Initially, the approach was to add a few lines of code to afl-fuzz.c to do record AFL's mutating inputs. This has been done (refer to the newly added lines #2347-2350), but it still does not do the task. However according to the output of test.c in this folder, this approach should have worked.

##Executing AFL on native AES
Run *fuzz-aessim-native.sh*. This takes care of everything and executes afl-fuzz with all the required parameters.
