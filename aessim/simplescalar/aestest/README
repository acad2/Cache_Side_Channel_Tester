README to generate training data: 
=================================

- *CAUTION* The VM has many tools installed. It requires 
  at least 2 GB space to run. If you have enough RAM space, 
	your system is likely to crash.

- gen_data.c is a simple, but hard-coded C program that 
	generates the training data. Feel free to modify it to 
	get smaller training data. But, in general, you could 
	compile and run it without any change

- compile: 

  gcc -o gen_data gen_data.c

- modifying cache size (optional):

  you can do it by modifying the file processor.config in this 
  directory

- run: 

  ./gen_data

- The training data will be saved in a file "miss_data_one_round.txt" 
  in the same directory.

- That's all.
